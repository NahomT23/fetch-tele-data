E-Commerce Platform with Telegram Bot Integration
A powerful and user-friendly e-commerce platform built with React, TypeScript, Express, Node.js, Stripe, Tailwind CSS, Redux, Cloudinary, Firebase Database, and the Telegram Bot API. This platform allows store owners to manage products, process purchases, and sync data seamlessly between the website and Telegram.

The standout feature of this project is its Telegram bot integration, which makes managing both the website and Telegram channel effortless. Store owners can create, update, or delete product listings directly from Telegram, and these changes are automatically reflected on the website. The system also notifies the owner of purchases via Telegram messages, providing a streamlined management experience.

Key Features
CRUD Operations via Telegram
The e-commerce platform integrates with a Telegram bot that allows store owners to manage product listings (create, update, delete) directly from the bot. Changes made in the Telegram bot are automatically reflected on both the website and Telegram channel.

Exclusive and Channel Posts
Owners can choose whether a product post should be exclusive to the website or appear both on the website and the Telegram channel. This flexibility allows for better content management across multiple platforms.

Seamless Synchronization
If a product is edited or deleted on Telegram, the corresponding post on the website is automatically updated or removed. Similarly, changes on the website are mirrored on the Telegram bot and channel.

Cloudinary for Image Management
Product images are stored and managed using Cloudinary, which ensures optimized image delivery, resizing, and secure storage. This integration provides better performance and scalability for handling image assets across the platform.

Stripe Integration for Payments
Stripe is integrated to handle payments securely. When users purchase items, they can check out directly on the website, and the store owner will receive a notification with the purchase details via Telegram.

Real-Time Notifications via Telegram
When a purchase is made, the store owner is immediately notified through a Telegram message containing the userâ€™s details, including the purchased items. This keeps the owner up to date with sales in real-time.

Redux for State Management
The platform uses Redux to manage application state efficiently, ensuring seamless updates to product data and shopping cart functionality.

Firebase Database for Scalable Data Storage
Firebase is used as the primary database for storing user data, orders, and product details. This ensures secure, scalable, and reliable data management while enabling real-time updates.

TypeScript for Robust Development
The platform is developed using TypeScript, providing type safety and enhanced maintainability. This helps in catching potential errors during development and improving code readability.

Responsive Design
Built with Tailwind CSS, the platform provides a responsive and clean design that adapts seamlessly to both desktop and mobile devices.
